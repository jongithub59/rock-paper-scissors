### Interactive, intense game vs. the computer. This project is from the Odin Project [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/)

Live preview [here](https://jongithub59.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/)

## Features:

* Interactive buttons to select your weapon of choice
* A record keeping score at the top of the screen
* A short message below announcing the victor of the round
* A final message displaying the final score and victor, preventing anymore rounds from happening

## Reflection

* Learned the basics of JavaScript to add content to the page
* Made a shorter, efficent, and understandable function after multiple reworks
* Used images for selection to circumvent the need for text validation and for a better design
